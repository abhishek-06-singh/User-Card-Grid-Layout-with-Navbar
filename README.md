# User Card Grid Layout with Navbar

This is a simple React project that displays user cards in a grid layout and has a navbar that shows any brand name. The user data is fetched from an API and a loading spinner is displayed while the data is being fetched.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- index.js: This is the entry point of the project. It renders the App component into the DOM.

- App.js: This component is the main component of the project. It fetches the user data from the API and renders the user cards in a grid layout. It also renders the navbar and handles the state of the selected brand.

- Loading.js and Loading.css: These files define a loading spinner component that is displayed while the data is being fetched.

- navbar.css: This file defines the styles for the navbar.

- styles.css: This file defines the global styles for the project.

## Dependencies

- react: The main library for building user interfaces with React.
- react-dom: The library that provides DOM-specific methods for React.
- react-icons: A library that provides a set of icons for React.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
